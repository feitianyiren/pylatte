Developers can now generate websites with Pylatte in Python 3, just as they might for Python 2x-based frameworks such as Django, Flask, or Bottle.\r\n\r\nVisit to http://www.pylatte.org/\r\npypi : http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pylatte\r\nmail : pylatte@pylatte.org\r\nFacebook Page : https://www.facebook.com/pylatte\r\n\r\n## Sample code\r\nThe following code is a example pyl file.\r\n\r\n<p>Pylatte</p>\r\n<$\r\npyl = \"HTML\" + \" + \" + \"python\"\r\n$>\r\n<p>\r\n<$=pyl$>\r\n</p>\r\nThe pyl code is translated by Pylatte to HTML in the browser.\r\n\r\n<p>Pylatte</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHTML + python\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Functions\r\nTranslation Engine Pylatte uses pyl file format. pyl consists of HTML and Python. pyl is fully translated by the Pylatte engine into HTML. It is unique feature of Pylatte.\r\n\r\n##Database\r\nTo use the database, external library must be installed: the MySQLdb(for mysql) module or pymongo3(for MonogoDB) module for Python 3.\r\nSimple and advanced SQL via specific functions that are similar to iBATIS are provided.\r\n\r\n##Session\r\nA session is needed to distinguish each client.\r\n\r\n##Filter\r\nIf a filter is set, select pages pass through the filter.\r\n\r\n##Form File\r\nIt is possible to upload a file to server via POST.\r\n\r\n##URL Mapping\r\nFor security purposes, URL mapping transfers virtual URLs accessed by clients to web pages."}
